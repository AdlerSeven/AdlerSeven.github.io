                but succes wasn't, on february 2020 I have stopped do streamming, but it was not a problem, int the early days of 2020 I found the furry fandom and
                it has insperated me in the march to join it. My first Sona but comes first in september 2020 and it was a protogen, but after a time I have changing it because 
                "it is boring when everything looking at the same", so I have make my own, it is a combination of a fox and a Pinata and after 3 design changes the
