                <p><right>Everything has start in 2017 but not as furry, as gamer. My first digital account that I have me was for Games,
                the name comes from a old friend and it combinates two games "Adler" from the game "" and "Seven" comes from "", 2019-2020 i was a streamer
                but succes wasn't, on february 2020 I have stopped do streamming, but it was not a problem, int the early days of 2020 I found the furry fandom and
                it has insperated me in the march to join it. My first Sona but comes first in september 2020 and it was a protogen, but after a time I have changing it because 
                "it is boring when everything looking at the same", so I have make my own, it is a combination of a fox and a Pinata and after 3 design changes the 
                new character was born, the inspirations comes from Bash (the Pinata), someone other on Twitter, hardcore Techno and be a sweet specie.
                In the same time I have learning my Girlfriend and sart my Education in Machine technology. And well we are now here!</right></p>

                <p><right>This Protogen was my first fursona created in november 2020, "coding, furry and do media stuff" was my start with really much success and
                it has going a long time, but after a time I reached a limit (Protogens are with the design limited and I have to much changed me) on the end august I need 
                a new character with more costomisation and more indentical to me. Only 2 weeks later I found a artist that make my ideas to reality, in the first conzept it 
                was planning a blue wolf but this was to borring for me. My hobbys, the music that I hear and many more has bringing me on the idea to me a pināta fox combination, 
                on the end of september the first conzept was ready and in october the final one.</right></p>
